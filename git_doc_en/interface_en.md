### Interface

![Interface menu screen](http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p374/ClockSelect/eVic/interface_zpshqw8kg89.png)

 * __1Watt On/Off__

   Enable increment of power setting by plus ±1.0 Watt instead of ±0.1 Watts.

  * __1C/5F On/Off__
  
    Enable increment of temperature setting by ±1°C and ±5°F instead of ±5°C and ±10°F

  * __Wake < > On/Off__

    Enable/Disable box wake up from sleep mode when pressing the + or - button.

  * __Temp °C/°F__

    Choose once and for all your temperature unit, between °C and °F. Nobody needs to switch back and forth between standards. Moreover, Farenheit is not even a standard. Maybe I'll replace it by Kelvins one day. Changing temperature unit by wrapping around the temperature has been disabled.

  * __PPwr On/Off__
  
    *__TEMP Mode Only__*  
    Toggle Priority Power mode On/Off. In temperature control modes, this switches the power and the temperature display; the power is displayed at top of screen and is directly editable by the + and - keys just like in Power mode, and the temperature is displayed on the first of the 3 informations lines in the center of the screen. Temperature remains editable in Edit mode.  
    The purpose of this function is near the preheat function in PWR mode; once you have set your correct vape temperature (not burning your dry cotton), your comfort come from the heat rise speed. This feature let you adjust this parameter more easily.

  * __Clicks__
  
    ![Clicks Menu](http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p374/ClockSelect/clicks_zpsoqy6ngvh.png)
        
    The Clicks submenu allows you to configure the action associated to a Fire button multi-clic. Configurable multi-clicks are double, triple and quadruple clicks.

    Possible actions are:
* None - do not do anything. 
* Edit - the mode of entering the editing indications on the main screen (3 clicks in the firmware from the manufacturer). 
* Clock - forced display of the clock as a logo on the main screen. 
* PPwr, power priority. - in the TK: the temperature and power readings on the screen change places. For convenient adjustment of the one and the other with the buttons (+ -). - in the varivatt mode - the pre-heating pre-setting screen is called up. 
* Mode - to switch to the next hover mode (TC -> Varivatt -> Bypass -> Smart ...). 
* On / Off - on / off the box. (5 clicks in the firmware from the manufacturer) 
* Profile - go to the profile selection screen with individual settings. 
* Tetris - challenge the game Tetris. 
* Flappy - challenge the game of drunk Birdie. 
* Saver - show screen saver.

    As a security feature, if none of the action are configured to be the "Edit" mode, the firmware will redefine the triple click action to "Edit" at next reset.
