* __Four lines for each type of thermal control: __

  When you enter this menu, the line for the current thermal monitoring mode (if selected) will be selected.
  After selecting the desired line, click Start to enter the resistance editing mode.
  Correct the resistance with the buttons (+ -).
  Clicking on Start without editing will change the status of the lock of the coil (lock).
  Editing non-zero resistance will automatically lock it.
  Long press on Start will re-read the resistance of the coil again.

* __Disposing (Zero All) __

  Clearing of all the resistances remembered by the mod, including the Smart and Varivatt modes.

* __Temperature Control (TCR) __

   In addition to the three customizable TC modes (M1, M2, M3), you can set fixed values ​​for the other modes (TEMP NI, TI, SS). For this:
   * Select the mode to unlock,
   * Long press the Start button to unlock this item. A suitable value will appear on the screen, you can edit it.
   * Repeated long press Start will return the default setting, if necessary.

* __Profiles (Profile) __

   [Profile Menu] (profiles_en.md)

* __Basic temperature (Cold) __

  The default is 20 degrees Celsius. Mod believes that this is the minimum temperature at which the user blocks the resistance for the TC. This value is involved in calculating the temperature of the spiral.

* __New Coil? (New) __

  If the resistance in the TC is not blocked, the mod can determine that another tank is installed, if its resistance is different by this predetermined percentage. The default is 5%.

* __ Compatibility check (Check: Yes / No) __

  Mode checks the spiral for the possibility of working with thermal control. "Heavy" coils can not pass the test on the TC (the mod switches to the varivatt mode), although they can work in this mode. This check mark can cancel this check.
